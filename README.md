# CCFP-citywide-crowd-flow-prediction
We propose a novel Citywide Crowd Flow Prediction (CCFP) model based on the combination of statistical rules and machine learning (XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost), which fully exploits the spatial dependence and two-level (weekly, and daily) periodicity of population flow to forecast crowd flow indexes in specific areas in the future
